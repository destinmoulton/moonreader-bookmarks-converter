## Arguably: Selected Essays - Christopher Hitchens (Highlight: 3; Note: 5)

- An Anglosphere Future
    - Doyle’s visit coincided with the height of this anti-British feeling, and at a dinner in his honor in Detroit he had this to say: You Americans have lived up to now within your own palings, and know nothing of the real world outside. But now your land is filled up, and you will be compelled to mix more with the other nations. When you do so you will find that there is only one which can at all understand your ways and your aspirations, or will have the least sympathy. That is the mother country which you are now so fond of insulting. She is an Empire, and you will soon be an Empire also, and only then will you understand each other, and you will realize that you have only one real friend in the world.

Any creatures that then exist will be as different from us as we are from bacteria or amoebae.

- Fraser’s Flashman: Scoundrel Time
    - Flashman stoutly observes: “In my experience the course of history is as often settled by someone’s having a belly-ache, or not sleeping well, or a sailor getting drunk, or some aristocratic harlot waggling her backside.
